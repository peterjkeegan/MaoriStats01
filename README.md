MaoriStats01
============

This R script looks at Māori language statistics that derive from New Zealand 
Census data currently available on the Web. The time series are irregular. 
I am looking for trends initially, not absolute numbers, as there are errors 
in the reporting (more on this later). I put some files here in Feb 2014
and did some further work in Dec 2014, Jan 2015 and finally May 2015.

All the data comes from Stats NZ (see their website).

I divided the R script into a number of sections, mainly so its easy for
me to remember what I did.

First, I plot the number of Māori by descent, ethnicity and Māori language 
speakers (only those claiming Māori ethnicity), from 1996 and do a rough 
projection to 2021, the most likely date of the next census. Note a question 
on language use has only been asked since 2001. Plot 1, shows there has been 
a reasonably consistent increase in the number of Māori claiming Māori descent 
and Māori ethnicity, but a reasonably steady decrease in the number of Māori 
language speakers.

In the next sections, I look more closely at the Māori language speakers 
in the following sections.

Section 2 displays Māori language speakers (only those of Māori ethnicity) 
by 4 age groups. Plot 2 clearly shows that in terms of absolute numbers 
there have been reasonably consistent decreases in all age groups (from 2001 
to 2013), except those of over the age of 64.

Section 3 displays the number of Māori language speakers by Region, from 2001 
to 2013. Again (Plot 3) there is a consistent decrease across all regions. 
The Bay of Plenty, Gisborne, Waikato and Northland have always had 
large Māori populations. Auckland now has a large number of Māori residents 
as a result of internal migration (myself included).

Section 4 displays the percentage of Māori language speakers by region. 
I.e., what percentage of the Māori population (in that region) claim to be 
speakers of Māori (Plot 4). Obviously, there are larger percentages of Māori 
speakers where there are higher percentages of Māori, although the reasons 
for this are historic and largely reflect delayed language shift in rural 
areas where Māori communities are still intact.

Section 5 displays the percentage of speakers by the percentage of the 
population for each region as a scatter plot (Plot 5), in some ways this in 
kind of collapsing or combining plots 4 and 5. There is a positive correlation 
between these variables.
