MaoriStats01
============

This R script look at Māori Māori language statistics that derive from New Zealand Census data currently available on the Web. The time series are irregular. I looking for trends initially, not absolute numbers, as there are errors in the reporting (more on this later). This is my 1st effort, which I'll improve and add to at the later stage.

The CSV file is something I constructed from a number of Stats NZ Excel spreadsheets (see the Stats NZ website).

I divided the R script into a number of sections, mainly so its easy for me to remember what I did.

In the 1st section I plot the number of Māori by descent, ethnicity and Māori language speakers (only those claiming Māori ethnicity), from 1996 and do a rough projection to 2021, the most likely date of the next census. Note a question on language use has only been asked since 2001. Plot 1, shows there has been a reasonably consistent increase in the number of Māori claiming Māori descent and Māori ethnicity, but a reasonably steady decrease in the number of Māori language speakers. In the next sections, I look more closely at the Māori language speakers in the following sections.
